        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This family-friendly dinner is just as good as takeout but made really easily in your slow cooker. We like to serve it with rice.</p>
        <p>Prep: 10 mins. Cook: 4 hrs 10 mins. Total: 4 hrs 20 mins. Servings: 6. Yield: 6</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cubed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>    
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>                   
        
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch, garlic powder, and ground ginger together in a small bowl. Toss chicken thighs in cornstarch mixture until they are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in the skillet until browned on all sides, 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Drain juice from the can of pineapple chunks into a measuring cup. You should have approximately 3/4 cup to 1 cup of juice.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/2 cup pineapple juice, chicken stock, rice vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce together in a slow cooker. Add browned chicken pieces and stir to coat chicken with the sauce. Cook on Low for 3 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup pineapple juice. Stir cornstarch mixture into the slow cooker. Increase the slow cooker heat to High and add pineapple chunks and chopped red bell pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook on High until the sauce is bubbly and thickened and bell pepper is crisp-tender, about 30 minutes. Garnish with chopped green onion.</li>
        </ol>
